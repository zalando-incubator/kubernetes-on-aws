# "fake" service account only used for attaching privileged PSP. kube-proxy will
# use the 'kubelet' identity (via kubeconfig file) because it needs to bootstrap
# before service IPs are avilable and therefore can't use the default
# serviceAccount identity which would try to connect to the apiserver via the
# service IP instead of the public address.
